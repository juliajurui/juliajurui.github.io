            <h2>June 2025 🏫🥨🐈☀️</h2>

            <p>
                Happy July everyone – we’re halfway through 2025!
            </p>

            <p>
                I’m writing this newsletter very late (I usually try to write it during the first weekend of the new month) because of various summer activities that have left me stressed and refreshed. I know that seems paradoxical, but isn’t that the definition of the summer before senior year? I’m refreshing myself via movie breaks, dance breaks, and summer break, yet I’m also stressed as I prepare for my last year of high school.
            </p>

            <h3>Wrapping up the school year</h3>

            <p>
                I know everyone says that junior year is the worst part of high school, but I can’t help but disagree. As I wrap up this so-called “nightmare” school year, I’ve realized that it’s actually my favorite of the three years I’ve experienced so far. Despite its rare ups and many, many downs, I learned so much about myself and found some real friends along the way.
            </p>

            <p>
                Things I’ve discovered about myself:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    I like to yap. When people meet me for the first time, they often perceive me as quiet or withdrawn. This could not be further from the truth. Around people I feel comfortable with, I open my mouth and word vomit a combination of life updates, stories, and hear-me-outs (i.e. cottage cheese is better than cheddar). Is this newsletter not a regurgitation of everything that happened to me in June? I’ll admit, my word vomit is not always the most eloquent – I’m not a unicorn, and therefore I don’t barf rainbows – but I get the point across (hopefully).  
                </li>

                <li>
                    My favorite snack is Dot’s Homestyle Pretzels. Within my 17 years of life, I’ve experimented with a wide variety of snacks: sweet, savory, sour, bitter, and even umami (did you know cheese counts as umami?) But there’s nothing that beats the satisfying crunch of seasoned pretzels. It might be the MSG, sure, but it could also be the mix of buttermilk, garlic, and cayenne pepper seasoning. I’ve recently been exploring an MSG-free alternative from Stellar Pretzels (aka THE Alaska Airlines snack), and their range of flavors never disappoints me.
                </li>

                <li>
                    I don’t feel guilty when I take breaks. This school year, I started using a Pomodoro timer to remind myself to rest. I use an app called Pomocat because it helps me alleviate feelings of anxiety and it has cats. When I look back at my Pomocat data, I realize that I deserve a break.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Summer bucket list</h3>

            <p>
                Since I wrote my New Year’s resolution list in my January newsletter, I feel like I should also share my summer to-do list with all of you.
            </p>

                <li>

            <p>
                As of today (July 7th), I’ve done 3 out of the 9 things on my bucket list… but I still have time!
