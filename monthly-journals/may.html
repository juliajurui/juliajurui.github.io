            <p>
                To my friends and family,
            </p>

            <p>
                Now that we’re almost halfway through 2025, I’ve begun to check off some things on my 2025 bucket list. You might remember it from my January newsletter, but just in case you don’t, I’ve copied the list down below.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Watching my sister graduate from college (complete!)
                </li>

                <li>
                    Junior prom (complete!)
                </li>

                <li>
                    Turning 17 and listening to ABBA’s Dancing Queen (complete!)
                </li>

                <li>
                    Senior skip week in the fall
                </li>

                <li>

                </li>

                <li>
                    Wicked Part 2
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Funnily enough, all 3 checked-off items happened in the month of May. I turned 17 in the middle of APs, and I listened to Dancing Queen for the first time as a 17-year-old during Junior Prom. Less than 24 hours later, I was on a plane to New York to watch my sister wear sky-blue robes and a graduation cap. A lot happened in so little time, but let’s start with the basics.
            </p>

            <h3>Look at me. I know, you can’t.</h3>

            <p>

            </p>

                APs were a welcome change of pace, although they arrived with an unwelcome influx of studying. For about a week, my routine was so different it felt like whiplash. Each day went something like this:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Get at least 8 hours of sleep. As someone who doesn’t have the best sleeping habits, I woke up each morning feeling grossly optimistic and energetic. The sun was shining (mocking me as I hunched over my desk), the birds were chirping (distracting me from the endless MCQs), and the weather was…weather-ing. Some cruel, probably balding adult (*cough cough* the collegeboard) decided that APs should take place in May, right when Seattle’s weather begins to take a turn for the better. It might’ve been the extra sleep or the sun, but I was strangely energetic throughout AP season.

                <li>
                    For morning exams - wake up at 6:30 AM. For afternoon exams – wake up at 9:30 AM. First things first, I am not a morning person. Let’s leave it at that…
                </li>

                <li>
                    Don my lucky red jacket. I don’t actually wear it for most of the exam (I run hot), but its presence is comforting to me. The jacket has seen me through 3 years of AP/SAT testing and final exams. Its soft red fabric is perfect for hiding the blood, sweat, and tears shed over each test (I’m joking, mostly).
                </li>

                <li>
                    Inhale extra cheddar goldfish during the 10-minute break. At this point, half of the exam is over, my post-AP plans are decided (cry in bed or go out with friends), and it’s time for me to gobble up my favorite AP snack. It’s crunchy, it’s cheesy, and it’s the best distraction from the nightmare that was Section I.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard (Winnie the Pooh)</h3>

            <p>
                There are high school seniors, college seniors, and people with back pain. But no matter what kind of senior you are, there is always a “goodbye”, “let's stay in touch” or my personal favorite – “I’llmissyoucomevisitdon’tforgetaboutmeplease” (said through tears). To my favorite seniors (those of you receiving this email), congratulations on 4 years of hard work + play. You are yappers, snackers, learners, and yearners. What are your next steps? Your summer plans? You may be free of school, but you aren’t free of me yet…
            </p>

            <p>
                As always, feel free to respond to this email. What are your thoughts?
            </p>

            <p>
                Love,
                Julia
