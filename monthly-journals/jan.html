            <h2>January 2025 📝🕺🥠🐍</h2>

            <p>
                To all my friends and family: happy (late) new year!
            </p>

            <p>
                It’s already 2025, which means by the end of this year, I’ll be thinking about the next four years of my life. The school year has been relatively uneventful so far, even though everyone says being a junior is the worst.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Speaking of the new year…here are some resolutions I’ve made:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Spend more time writing for fun. We write so many reports and essays for school that it takes away the intrinsic motivation to write. In my psychology class, we learned about this idea called the tip of the tongue phenomenon. Have you ever felt like the information is right there, but you can’t quite reach it? You’ve probably experienced the tip of the tongue phenomenon. When I write, I’m constantly thinking about words I know the meaning of, but I can’t quite recall the exact term. Writing is more challenging than I thought…</li>
                <li>Sleep more, study less. This is a repeat resolution from last year: long story short, I didn’t do a very good job of upholding it in 2024. My priorities are always health first and education second. But it’s easier said than done to translate these priorities into action.</li>
                <li>Hydrate or diedrate! I truly believe drinking water is the solution to most problems. Headaches? Drink water. Tired? Drink extra cold water. And no, I don’t mean chugging 20 ounces of water in 30 seconds. I mean taking small sips throughout the day. I haven’t been sticking to this resolution very well. But there’s still time for improvement! Right?</li>
                <li>Give more hugs. Weirdly, the hugs that squeeze the air out of me are the hugs I love most. Hugs make me feel safe and supported and loved and 1000% better. I’m trying to be a better hugger, so give me tips, ok?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Cramming for finals</h3>

            <p>
                Whenever I cram, I always find myself snacking on something. Someone suggested that I chew gum instead, and it’s been life changing. I have a huge pack of Wrigley’s Extra Long Lasting Flavor Spearmint Gum™ that I used almost every day while studying for finals. It expired on August 5th, 2024, which is probably why it’s a little less chewable than preferred.
            </p>

            <p>
                One thing I’ve learned over the years is that not all classes require the same amount of studying. Freshman Julia was putting way too much effort into easy A classes. Junior Julia knows better. I made a finals study calendar on Notion during winter break, and I proceeded to not use it at all. I mostly relied on Quizlets and teacher-provided study guides to prepare.
            </p>

            <p>
                My worst final, by far, was for math. I struggled the most with timing, which is something I struggle with for most tests. I always fight the urge to quadruple check my answers because I know I don’t have time for that. When you’re running out of time, you come up with funny solutions to problems. Once, in 6th grade, I forgot how many inches were in a foot. I had an 8.5 x 11” piece of printer paper, and I knew that I was exactly 5 feet tall. It turns out I was around 5 and a half papers tall, so I deduced that there were 12 inches in a foot.
            </p>

            <p>
                During my math exam, I came up with funny solutions too. When I had 20 seconds left on the clock, I gave up on the calculus and started plugging test values into my calculator. Surprisingly, I got that question right. Unsurprisingly, I got the other questions (ones I had actually used calculus for) wrong. What does that say about my understanding of calculus?
            </p>

            <h3>Physical poetry and dance</h3>

            <p>
                Each year, I perform in the Physical Poetry show at the Shorecrest Performing Arts Center. My group does cultural dance, and it’s always fun to see what other groups do. The weekend was busy and exhilarating, but so much fun. A few weeks after Physical Poetry, my dance group auditioned for a chance to perform at Benaroya Hall. Audition results come out next week, so stay tuned!
            </p>

            <h3>Ringing in the new year...in red</h3>

            <p>
                For those who celebrate, happy lunar new year! I started the day by wearing my favorite red shirt (stolen from my sister, of course). At school, I attended a lunar new year celebration organized by the Asian American Student Union (AASU). Did any of you see that promotional reel I shared on Instagram? I’m always looking for reel ideas, so let me know if you have any.
            </p>

            <p>
                For me, January 1st is a time for reflection on the past year. When was I most happy, and what did I do to achieve that happiness? In contrast, the lunar new year is a time for hope and anticipation. I’m looking forward to so many things in the year of the snake, let me list a few:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Watching my sister graduate from college</li>
                <li>Junior prom</li>
                <li>Turning 17 and listening to ABBA’s Dancing Queen</li>
                <li>Senior college visit week in the fall</li>
                <li>Sweater weather</li>
                <li>Mariah Carey’s IT’S TIME!!!</li>
                <li>Wicked Part 2</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                My zodiac sign is the Rat, and apparently Rats will enjoy financial success in the year of the snake. I’m crossing my fingers…
            </p>

            <p>
                Let me know what you think of these monthly newsletters! Are they readable? Did you enjoy reading?
            </p>

            <p>
                Lots of love,
                Julia
