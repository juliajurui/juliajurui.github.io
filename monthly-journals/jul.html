            <h2>July 2025 🎓🧠💃🕺</h2>

            <p>
                To all my friends and family, happy August!
            </p>

            <p>
                It’s crazy to think that a year from now, I’ll be preparing to start university instead of another year of high school. I know senior year goes by fast, but I’ll try to keep up with these newsletters as much as I can. Speaking of university…
            </p>

            <h3>Researching colleges</h3>
                
            <p>
                I debated mentioning the college application process in these newsletters because I know so many of my peers are already thinking about it. I didn’t want to be yet another source of stress in the constant echo-chamber that is the application process, but I thought it would be interesting to document my journey through this supposedly “harrowing” time of my life. For my friends going through a similar process, I’d love to hear your thoughts!
            </p>

            <p>
                For me, July was a month of research. From Scoir to common data sets, I felt like I was constantly wading through a swamp of positive thoughts on how College A “saved my life” or how University B “was the best decision I ever made”, etc etc. Of course, the unrelenting glazing did not help my indecisive self desperately trying to narrow down The List to something more manageable. My pros/cons chart looked a little too positive for just about every college I researched.
            </p>

            <p>
                At a certain point, I realized that having the “perfect” college list was futile and decided to go with the flow: things tend to decide themselves for me if I’m patient and see how the situation plays out. Also, I was getting a little too chalant and needed to assert my dominance over the college application process (my motto for the next few months).
            </p>

            <h3>Cognitive neuroscience</h3>

            <p>
                I have a love-hate relationship with this field. Taking a cog neuro class over the summer was meant to resolve my 1/5th life crisis over my college major. Ultimately, the crisis was handled, but not before I experienced another existential crisis over whether I wanted to pursue scientific research. If research meant writing papers on the retinogeniculostriate (say it 5 times fast, I dare you), I was ready to consider going into industry instead.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thankfully, cognitive neuroscience isn’t all about memorizing freakishly long words (“Quick, she needs surgery on the retinogeniculostriate pathway!”). It’s also about understanding emotion, implicit bias, and human consciousness. It’s a surprisingly philosophical field, encompassing various aspects of existence that stem from our weird and special primate minds (she's not like other brains).
            </p>

            <h3>Dancing through life</h3>

            <p>
                Spending half of July dancing at the historic Moore Theater was simultaneously exhausting and fulfilling. Under chandeliers and arched ceilings, I learned choreography and rehearsed alongside dancers from age 6 to 60. My experience at the Moore reminded me why I love to dance. For me, dance was yet another extracurricular activity I had been doing since age 6. I had danced for so long, why quit now? It was something I felt neutral about. But whether it’s jazz, contemporary, or cultural dance, I love dance because I get to perform. And my favorite thing by far about performing is the lead-up. It’s the hair and make-up and costumes and getting ready with friends in the bathroom. It’s the feeling of anticipation as you wait in the wings, hidden behind the masking curtains. Most of all, it’s when the lights turn on, the music starts to play, and suddenly, you’re taking your bows already.
            </p>

            <p>
                When asked the question of “why dance?” one of my fellow performers posed a follow-up of “why not dance?”. Even when my non-dancer friends claim to be clumsy, dance is present in their lives in little ways. Dance is the rhythmic head-bobbing or foot-tapping to pop songs in the car. It’s the secret dance sessions in front of the bathroom mirror when you’re brushing your teeth (please tell me I’m not the only one who does this…). As I begin my senior year of high school and find myself with less and less time for official dance rehearsals, I’ll try my best to look for dance in other aspects of my daily life.
            </p>

            <p>
                As always, feel free to respond to this email with your thoughts. What do you think of college admissions? If you’re applying to college right now, how are you asserting dominance over the application process? Did you say retinogeniculostriate 5 times fast? Does anyone else dance in front of the bathroom mirror while getting ready for bed?
            </p>

            <p>
                Hopefully, otherwise I will be very embarrassed.
            </p>

            <p>
                With love,
                Julia
