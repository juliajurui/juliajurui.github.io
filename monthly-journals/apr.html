            <h2>April 2025 ü•®üê§üìñüç®</h2>

            <p>
                To all my family and friends,
            </p>

            <p>
                April felt especially fast for me. Between junior year and the upcoming exam season, I‚Äôve been swamped up to my quickly receding hairline (I‚Äôm joking, probably). Still, I wanted to keep up with this monthly tradition. I like these newsletters because they help me find joy in the little things (like naps that feel disorienting when you wake up or Dot‚Äôs Seasoned Pretzels). I‚Äôm also trying to figure out what ‚Äúmy voice‚Äù sounds like in writing. For those of you reading, how do you hear ‚Äúmy voice‚Äù through this newsletter? Is it high-pitched and energetic? Is it calming and slow? Let me know!!
            </p>

            <p>
                My spring break staycation was uneventful, yet relaxing. I enjoyed the nice weather by opening my windows while reading or studying. For the first time in a while, I took time to notice the sounds in my neighborhood. In the house on the other side of the block, there‚Äôs a kid who plays baseball (?). A few houses down, children play tag in the yard. Birds compose songs of their own as I listen to mainstream pop while studying. I‚Äôm trying to find ways to listen more in life. Whether it‚Äôs rolling down my windows as I drive or listening to the random creaking and clunking of my school‚Äôs heating system, stopping to listen can be surprisingly hard.

            <p>
                Besides taking some time for myself during spring break, I also learned how to be a productive bum‚Ä¶
            </p>

            <h3>How to be a productive bum (from a professional bum)</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Fall into a self-made routine. Throughout the year, so much of my routine is decided by homework, extracurriculars, and school. When summer rolls around, I find myself completely lost. There‚Äôs no school to wake up early for. There‚Äôs no dance practice to attend or choir rehearsals to drive to. The loss of routine is a little jarring, and I always find it hard to adjust during the first week of summer break. Slowly creating a self-controlled routine can feel difficult, and yet, it‚Äôs incredibly productive.</li>

                <li>Find a good book to read. If any of you have experienced the bum lifestyle, you‚Äôll relate to the urge to doomscroll on social media. Don‚Äôt do it. Instead, hunt through your bookshelf for nostalgic reads. My nostalgic read was the Greenglass House by Kate Milford, which I read as a fifth grader back in the late 2010s. It‚Äôs a children‚Äôs mystery about a 12-year-old boy who investigates the secrets of the inn his parents run. It has cozy winter vibes, with a touch of suspense. What are some of your nostalgic reads?</li>

                <li>Go outside. For me, this took the form of short walks to the local Safeway, where I bought pepper jack cheese, ranch, and apple cider (I tried to buy nonalcoholic wine but it didn‚Äôt work out‚Ä¶). These walks were a source of much needed Vitamin D after a dark Seattle winter. I even collected flowers to press between the pages of my textbooks. Walks de-bumify me and remind me to touch grass once in a while.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Since exams are fast-approaching, I‚Äôm going to wrap up this newsletter here. I‚Äôm hoping my May newsletter is a little longer‚Ä¶
            </p>

            <p>
                As always, let me know what you think of this newsletter!
            </p>

            <p>
                Much love,
                Julia¬†
