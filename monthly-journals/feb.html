            <h2>February 2025 ü§ßü§íüóΩ‚úàÔ∏è</h2>

            <p>Dear friends and family,</p>
            
            <p>
                I started the month with snow, and thankfully, school was canceled. I loved not having school, but I did NOT enjoy making up all the missed tests and quizzes. I think it‚Äôs funny how Seattleites freak out over a teensy bit of snow. We‚Äôre a little too chalant when it comes to winter weather. Maybe it was the cold and maybe it was the stress, but I got hit with a nasty sickness in mid-February.
            </p>

            <h3>Julia's tips & tricks for surviving the common cold</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Drink lots of fluids. Water, tea, even a Celsius. Anything that keeps you hydrated works. During the first two days of being sick, my voice sounded like a raspy mess. I relied on peppermint tea and warm honey water every day. 10/10 would recommend.</li>
                <li>Get a reliable thermometer. My own thermometer would fluctuate between 102 degrees F and 94 degrees F. Talk about indecisive...</li>
                <li>Find something to do that ISN‚ÄôT homework. Nothing is worse than simultaneously feeling cold and hot, all while frantically integrating. I‚Äôm definitely not speaking from personal experience. Just trust me: don‚Äôt do it.</li>
                <li>Use saline nasal spray. Whether you‚Äôre clearing up your congestion or washing toothpaste stains off the side of a car, nasal spray is the multipurpose solution to all your problems. This message is not sponsored by Ayr Nasal Mist, but maybe it should be.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>New York diaries</h3>
                
            <p>
                Over mid-winter break, I briefly visited my older sister in New York City. Despite the occasional curious smell, I loved the energy in the freezing air. I think that Seattleites and New Yorkers tend to match their weather. In Seattle, everyone is cold and a little lethargic. For all the Seattleites reading ‚Äì is the Seattle Freeze myth or fact? In contrast, New Yorkers are like the unapologetically loud wind that sweeps through each street. The wind seriously scared me on more than one occasion. I‚Äôve never heard the wind howl in between buildings.
            </p>

            <p>
                The other thing I loved about New York was the food. I visited this life-changing hot pot restaurant called Mala Town. It was so delicious I almost cried. Each food truck served mouth-watering dishes, and I tried some really yummy maltagliati. Whether I was at a restaurant or making empanadas in someone‚Äôs college dorm, I always ate well.
            </p>

            <p>
                The pinnacle of my experience in NYC was visiting Caf√© Wha! The live band had everyone dancing and singing at the top of their lungs. The poor waiters had to wade through swaths of people partying in the aisles. I think nothing is more representative of New York than music, dancing, and food. Maybe I‚Äôm romanticizing the city a little too much, but there‚Äôs a reason it‚Äôs the 49th largest city in the world.

                Songs from NYC

            <ul>
                <li>Golden Slumbers ‚Äì The Beatles</li>
                <li>Hotel California ‚Äì Eagles</li>
                <li>Stick Season ‚Äì Noah Kahan</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Travel always reminds me to dream, and this trip definitely inspired some much-needed ambition after a long period of burnout. Whenever I fall in love with a new place, I imagine revisiting in 5, 10, or 20 years. But in order to travel, I have to work hard in the present and have faith in my future.
